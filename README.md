<h2>Ripple Effect</h2>

<h4>This is a simple css only and js approach for implementing Material design ripple effect animation.</h4>

I have made both the versions of ripple animation.

<h4>Css only Approach</h4>

```html
  <button type="button" class="ripple ripple-light btn-style1">Button</button>
```

<h4>Javascript Approach (pure js without jquery)</h4>

```html
  <button type="button" class="ripple ripple-light btn-style1">Button</button>
```

<h5>Both approaches might look similar but if you look properly they arent same.</h5>

<h5>Css only approach starts the ripple effect from the middle of the button no matter where u click on the button</h5>

<h5>Js approach start the ripple effect from the point where u click on the Button</h5>

* There is an extra class ripple-light and ripple-dark this is for the color of the ripple effect 

* This is not limited to button tag u can add it in almost any tag
